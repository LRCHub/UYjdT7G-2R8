You'll always find me near a man with a horn
Find me there from dark until dawn
That's a place where music is born so fine

Just listen while he takes his solo apart
Watch him close his eyes from the start
Hear that music pour from his heart so fine

So sweetly he plays and he says it so well
Completely up under his spell

So if you're in the mood for music and love
Just forget the stars up above
For you'll find you'll be drawn
To the man with the horn
To the man with the horn
To the man with the horn
